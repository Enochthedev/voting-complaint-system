# New Vote Notification - Quick Reference

## What It Does

Automatically notifies all students when a lecturer creates a new active vote.

## Key Files

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `supabase/migrations/033_create_new_vote_notification_trigger.sql` | Database trigger migration |
| `scripts/test-new-vote-notification-trigger.js` | Test script |
| `docs/NEW_VOTE_NOTIFICATION_TRIGGER.md` | Full documentation |

## Trigger Logic

```
New Vote Created (is_active = true)
    ↓
Trigger: notify_on_new_vote
    ↓
Function: notify_students_on_new_vote()
    ↓
Create notification for each student
    ↓
Students see notification in UI
```

## Notification Format

```javascript
{
  type: 'new_vote',
  title: 'New vote available',
  message: 'A new vote has been created: [Vote Title]',
  related_id: '[Vote UUID]',
  is_read: false
}
```

## Testing

```bash
# Run the test
node scripts/test-new-vote-notification-trigger.js

# Expected: All tests pass ✅
```

## UI Integration

- **Icon:** 📄 FileText
- **Color:** Cyan
- **Group:** "Votes"
- **Click Action:** Navigate to `/votes` page

## Common Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Create Active Vote
```
Lecturer creates vote with is_active = true
→ All students receive notification ✅
```

### Scenario 2: Create Inactive Vote (Draft)
```
Lecturer creates vote with is_active = false
→ No notifications sent ✅
```

### Scenario 3: Activate Draft Vote
```
Lecturer updates vote from is_active = false to true
→ No notifications (trigger only fires on INSERT) ❌
→ Future enhancement needed
```

## Quick Checks

### Verify Trigger Exists
```sql
SELECT * FROM pg_trigger 
WHERE tgname = 'notify_on_new_vote';
```

### Check Recent Notifications
```sql
SELECT * FROM notifications 
WHERE type = 'new_vote' 
ORDER BY created_at DESC 
LIMIT 10;
```

### Count Students
```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM users WHERE role = 'student';
```

## Troubleshooting

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| No notifications created | Check if vote is active and students exist |
| Wrong notification count | Verify student count matches notification count |
| Trigger not firing | Check if trigger is enabled on votes table |
